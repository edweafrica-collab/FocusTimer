# FocusTimer ⏱️ 

The Free, Crash-Proof Desktop Timer for Live Events.

Stop trusting browser tabs. FocusTime is a native Windows app built for Churches, AV Teams, and Conferences that works 100% offline.

Why Use It?

🔒 Rock-Solid: No internet needed. Won't sleep. Won't drift.

🧠 Smart Warnings: Gentle orange/red borders guide speakers without panic.

📉 Overtime Tracking: Counts up (negative time) after 00:00 so speakers know they are late.

🖥️ Dual Screen: Controls on your laptop, clean timer on the projector.
